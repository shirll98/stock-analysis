# Green Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the stock market data for 2017 and 2018. The analysis will compute the total daily volume and return a percentage value for each ticker entity.
This analysis will use VBA and the understanding of for loops, if-then statements, logical operators, and nested loops to compute the analysis data.

## Results
The analysis suggests that majority of the companies on the list in 2017 had a positive return but TERP. In 2017 DQ was a good company to invest with a percentage of return of almost 200%! While in 2018, majority of the stocks had a negative return except for ENPH and RUN. Overall, the analysis shoes that ENPH had the most consistent return within the two years. Aside from the stock data, the refractored script took 0.5 seconds less to run than the original script. Evidently, the refractored script definitely ran more efficient than the original.

## Summary

-What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring code is that it will take less time to analyze due to less steps and improve the logic of the code to make it easier for readers. The refractored code will run faster and be more efficient than the origianl script.
A disadvantage of refractoring code is that it can be time consuming. In addition, the refractored code may not necessarily run faster or be more efficient than the original code.

-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
For this particular analysis, the refractored code ran a lot faster than the original code.
However, if the format of the data structure is altered (column inserted or headers different) then this script may not be able to perform the analysis.
